Worse Than Spam: Issues In Sampling Software Developers
http://st.uni-trier.de/~baltes/papers/esem16-sampling.pdf

•	Drawing a random sample is rarely possible
•	Public media is the best way to get mass information
•	Sampling could be unethical due to the fact that Github users put down their email without the intention of having other users know this information
•	Only a few companies provide the names of their Software Developers  use convenience sampling
•	Detailed information about Software Developers is needed, but not available  random sampling is preferred, but convenience sampling must be used in most cases  biased sample
•	Sampling for use of sketches/diagrams in software engineering practice with 394 participants
o	Network & motivate
o	2 social networks and online communities
♣	some members were critical about using these channels and this was most intensive recruitment
o	German news site article about survey to encourage participants (most efficient)
o	advertise on twitter
•	Directly contacting companies  no gatekeeper
•	Github GHTorrent provides username, real name, company, location, and email (good data quality)
•	“Issue: Relying on convenience samples or samples drawn from single online platforms may lead to biased results.“

•	how perceptions of users influence work
•	Found that both gender and tenure diversity are significant, positive predictors of productivity
•	Survey on teamwork with diversity, 816 responses
•	75% male, 25% female
•	60% web developer, 21% manager/team leader, 21% desktop developer
•	Males are overrepresented as IT staff/system administrators or developers, females as academics and software developers
•	Males typically had more years of IT/programming experience
•	Females only account for 9% of Github
•	Communication
o	73% on Github
o	63% email
o	54% instant messaging
o	52% in person
•	Teamwork
o	“open source developers come and go much [more] frequently than in a company”
o	fluid teams 53%, commercial teams 19%,

Visualizing Collaboration and Influence in the Open-Source Software Community

•	How demographics of geographic locations and backgrounds affect relationships on Github, successive commits or contributions to projects
•	Geo-scatter maps were created with data collection from Github (including a “complete social graph of 500,000 follow links as well as over 1,000,000 commits and 50,000 users.”)
•	Small multiples are used to compare many different parts of the graphs which can be filtered
•	Further analysis goes beyond classifying a single location as ‘San Francisco’. For example, the graph will include more specific locations like Oakland and San Jose.
•	Finding: In Paris, developers seem to mostly follow and not followed with the exceptions of Sydney, Berlin, and Tokyo.
•	Findings are mostly assumptions about patterns found in data visualizations

Question: Based on how popular Github is on the global scale, where should IBM and our open source projects be more involved?
